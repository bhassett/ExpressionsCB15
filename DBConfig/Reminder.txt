Reminder when using the db.xml.config

1. All xml config will be loaded automatically during application startup.
2. If creation of multiple db.xml.config is intended. Make sure that there is no duplicate config values in all configurations.
3. If creation of config file is intended. Copy path the file and change the .config extension to any extension.
   Ex. db.xml.bak, db.xml.config.bak, etc..
